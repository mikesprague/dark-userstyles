# Dark / Night-mode Userstyles for Stylish

Collection of userstyles I have made, or tweaked to my liking, for some websites
that I frequent. All userstyles implement a dark theme or *night-mode* in the
websites they apply to.

These can used by going to the Options panel in your Stylish extension and then
choosing import. Tested in [Stylish for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe)
and [Stylish for Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/)
but should also work in [Stylish for Safari](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.sobolev.stylish-5555L95H45)
and [Stylish for Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylish/).

All userstyles are very much works in progress. Forks encouraged and pull
requests accepted :octocat:

Additional userstyles can be found at [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/).
Once I feel these are closer to *complete* I will probably post them there as well.
